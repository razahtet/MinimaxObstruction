# SupremeObstruction
The pencil and paper game Obstruction created online, but you can either play with 2-players, or against a computer with three different difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
You can also change how many spaces there are on the board, up to 12 X 12.
This games uses minimax to get the best computer move, depending on the difficulty. Depending on the size of the board and how many spaces are left on the board, the computer may not always use minimax. It will only use minimax in the last 36 spaces or so.
